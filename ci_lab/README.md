# **📌 Continuous Integration (CI) Lab**
Welcome to the **CI Lab**! In this lab, you will extend your work from the Testing Lab by setting up a **Continuous Integration (CI) pipeline** using **GitHub Actions**. This pipeline will automatically run tests and enforce code quality whenever changes are pushed to the repository.

---

## **📌 Lab Objectives**
By completing this lab, you will:
✅ Configure **GitHub Actions** to run automated tests on every commit and pull request.  
✅ Extend test coverage by writing **additional test cases**.  
✅ Implement **linting** to enforce code quality.  
✅ Learn how to **troubleshoot failed CI builds**.  
✅ Collaborate effectively by reviewing and merging **Pull Requests (PRs)**.

## **📌 Getting Started**
## **📌 Copy Files to the Fork of Your Team Repository**
Once you've cloned this repository, copy the files into your **team repository** under the appropriate directory.

```bash
cp -r * /path/to/your/team/repository/ci-lab/
cd /path/to/your/team/repository/ci-lab/
```

## **📂 Lab Overview**
In this lab, you will:  
✔️ Set up **GitHub Actions** for Continuous Integration.  
✔️ Automate running **test cases** on every **push** and **pull request**.  
✔️ Enforce **code quality checks** using **Flake8** for Python linting.  
✔️ Extend **test coverage** by adding **new test cases**.
